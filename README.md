gradient-weather
================
An interactive weather website tell’s you the basic weather information and changes gradients based on that.

### Story
The website is based around the gradient, one full page of different gradients that’s connected to different levels of temperature. If it’s raining and snowing it will show a pale/white gradient, if it’s the opposite a sunny day it’s going to show an orange/warm gradient. The website is live updating with smooth transitions between the temperatures, it’s also showing an icon and a text based information to make it more understandable. To get most out of the website you will be able to scrub through the time to see what the weather is going to be later that day.

### Ideas
+ Gradient changing based on the weather.
+ Updating live weather information.
+ Moving icons based on the weather.
+ Be able to change the time.
